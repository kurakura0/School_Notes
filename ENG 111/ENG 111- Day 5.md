Context gives you a way to start essays. Context is the conversation going on. Your job as an academic is to enter conversations and contribute significantly to them. To enter a conversation, you must rhetorically listen. Resist the urge to talk, and shut up and listen. There's no way to contribute to it without understanding it fully.

The way to contribute to a conversation is to prove to others that you have a voice worth listening to. The battle in life is to give your essential self in your writing. What does your brain see the world as. Show what makes you unique and distinct. The battle is to keep people reading your stuff and not other's stuff. 

Life lesson- You have to get people interested in you. People won't find out about what you have to offer if you don't get people interested in your essential self. 

Another life lesson- You are going to fail a lot. You can't know what's possible without trying something out. 

FOR INTRODUCTIONS- You CANNOT mention COVID-19, the names of the articles, or the author's names until you are in at least the fourth sentence of the introduction. You still want those things in there and cannot be left out, but they need to be gradually introduced. You show the audience a conversation beyond the pandemic, the articles, and the author's names. Build an introduction that works. 

What you do when you write a paper, you start brainstorming the things that you associate with the event. Build a list of possible introductions and go from there.
