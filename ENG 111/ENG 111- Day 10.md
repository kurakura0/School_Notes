Rhetorical Triangle- 
![[Pasted image 20241010095942.png]]
Developed by Aristotle to analyze plays rhetorically. The rhetorical triangle analyzes appeals to the audience. All elements of the triangle must be in harmony to work correctly. You cannot have just one of these elements. They are all singular words, not plural despite having the letter s at the end. 

Ethos is the 'credibility' or 'believability' of an author. It is related to ethics. 

Logos is about appealing to the audience's logic. Did you make logical choices in writing? 'Did you reason well?' It is related to logic. 

Pathos is appealing to the emotion of the audience. Pathos is used to show that you have the human connection, showing that you are a 'good human.' It is related to empathy and sympathy. 

The last two elements of the rhetorical triangle are harmony and unification/unity. 

Every time that you have logos and pathos, you gain in ethos. Every time that you appeal to the audience in some sort of way, they begin to trust your work. Each paragraph must be devoted to one SINGLE device. They cannot stray. The best essays according to the professor are ones that choose at least 2 elements from the triangle because it shows that you have a solid understanding of rhetoric. 

Time. That is the only thing that sets you apart from others. Taking the time to learn things and it will pay you back tenfold. 

What we have covered in the past weeks all relates on how to make your writing unique. What sets you apart from others and how to use rhetoric to achieve your goals.

'Cogs in the machine'- An expression that explains that cogs keep the whole thing running.  

Stance refers to the attitude authors take toward their topic, while tone refers to the choices that an author makes to help communicate their stance. 

Your audience in college is the general academic audience. You are allowed to write complex ideas because they can decipher them. The general academic audience is not stupid.
However, don't write all complex things. You can sprinkle in complex ideas, and you must put them in, but you need to switch between simpler and complex ideas to keep the reader engaged and not make them feel stupid and tune out. 

Find authors that you can relate to. Find people that have a style of writing that you like. Model your writing to theirs. Do not become a copy of them, just sprinkle in bits of them. If you like the style of writing, other people may like it too. In college, you do not immediately know your own style, so your job is to find it. 

English is not one of the sciences. It is one of the humanities. Since the sciences call for the passive voice, it should be used there. But in english, you should be using the active voice. The passive voice distances the subject from the verb. In some cases it just erases the subject altogether. In active voice, the verb has to obey the subject. Active voice is when the subject is acted upon by a verb.

==Do not use the passive voice in this next essay.== Put the subject in front of the verb, because you want to give the subject credit. They spent a lot of time on that speech/literature, so give credit where credit is due. You should always default to active voice unless told otherwise.
