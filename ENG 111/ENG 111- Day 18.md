<u>Vocabulary</u>
Anecdotes- Small stories

<u>Notes</u>
Come to the next 2 classes with questions.

Thursday 12/5 and Tuesday 12/10 are strict workshop days.

In the essay, don't dumb down fracking. Everyone already knows what fracking is. 

If you're just looking at one oppositional voice, quote them once. If doing two voices, a single quote per is fine. Two oppositional voices is solid because it shows that you have done research and makes writing a counterargument easier. 

For modes, use at least 3 of them. The first intro of a mode will be in the first body paragraph about the modes. Another will be in the counterargument, and the final one will be of the main point. You should place the image to the right of the body paragraph. 

<u>The last lesson of the semester: Titles</u>
x:y

x = hook
y = direction

3-6 words for the x
5-8 words for the y

The y is never a sentence, it is a phrase.

The x will have something with personality, and the y will be something very clear. 

A sample title could be x: the negative effects of fracking.

X is the tricky part. You will play off of something that happens during the essay. 

The professor's example was "The Reel Story of Catching the Big Fish: A Concise History of Famous Fishing Anecdotes"

Another example would be "Nourishing Minds and Harvesting Hope: Positive Effects of Fracking in the United States"

"I don't want you to spend 20 hours on a title". This isn't a massive thing compared to the rest of the things that we've covered this semester

Priority things for the essay: Repetend, hook and look, mode sandwiches, and counterargument.

Use the damn checklist (day 13)
