<u>Vocabulary</u>
Efficacy- The ability to produce a desired or intended result.

<u>Notes</u>
In a modern context, an echo chamber is a place where you go to hear the same ideals or notions as you. It is a human compulsion to be around people that share your own perspective. As a researcher, you cannot limit yourself to one point of view, remaining in an echo chamber. Critically think here. 

Switch search engine to duckduckgo when researching. 

Critical thinking is the ability to sincerely stand in other people's shoes. 

Mode Sandwiches-
1. Introduce the Mode
2. Give the Mode
3. Explain the Mode

When using ANY mode, you must use a mode sandwich, just like a quote sandwich. A mode should be introduced ~once every other body paragraph. The essay requires at least 2 other modes, but around 4 modes should be used. 

<u>Notes specifically for the Annotated Bibliography</u>
Works Cited Page vs Bibliography
- A works cited page simply includes any piece 
- A bibliography includes every single thing that was consulted during research. This includes any form of media, even short form content. 

This assignment requires 5 things, which is different than the essay. The key to this assignment is to just show the first 5 sources that you came upon. This assignment by no means is directly obligated to be used for the essay assignment. However, this is not in your best interest. The bibliography assignment is just to get more research done. The expectation for this assignment is double digit (10+) sources if possible. 

Annotation means to comment on. All to be done in the paragraph beneath each entry is to talk to myself. "This was a horrible resource but this thing on page blah blah blah was useful" or "This resource had great depth and was extremely informative". Ask questions, make sure to include everything that was useful and that you learned from the article.

The main thing that people mess up on this assignment is the formatting, not the annotations themselves. 

**Are commas, period, italics, hanging indents, everything in line/in place. Make sure to alphabetize the assignment. If not, a whole letter grade is cut off.**

The author's name should come first, formatted "Last name, First name." 

If no name is present, then list the name of the article. If the work starts with the word 'the', start with the second word of the title and relocate the 'the' to the end after a comma. 

Specifics: 
- Each thing put in the bibliography is called an entry. 
- Beneath each entry comes the annotation
- Each annotation should be ~half a page long, double spaced. 7-10 sentences per citation is expected.
- One of the entries can be one of the modes that you will include in your essay. This is a multi-modal essay.
- Even if a source sucks, there should still be an annotation regarding why it should not be used.
