<u>Notes</u>
Don't work on english stuff until Thursday.

Every time we finish an essay, we will get like half a day off. We will talk about punctuation in class and then be released early.

Variety must be used to engage the audience. Sometimes the comma is right, sometimes a period is right. Other times the right choice is a semicolon. It is just used to engage the audience and to give them something else to look at.

--Semicolons--
Three rules. Only really need to know one though.

1. The only thing you need to really know, IC = independent clause. You just have to be comfortable recognizing independent clauses. IC; IC. Semicolons must be used to connect or join 2 independent clauses. Subjects are what control a sentence. Subjects are typically found at the beginning of the sentence. IC's must be similar in content, structure, and length to be joined with a semicolon. This does not mean identical, just similar.
2. IC; AC, IC. The comma is the <u>most</u> important part right here. It is a technique used in a kind of fancy way. It draws attention to itself if used wrong. Used more sparingly. 
3. Complex Serial Lists. List of names relating to one another with semicolons between items and their description. These lists should still use a coordinating conjunction.

The most important part of semicolons is that they don't change the meaning of the two clauses. They are just used to connect similar independent clauses. Semicolons should be used 2-5 times in essays written in ENG 111. There is no real rule for how many to use, it is just used to spice up the writing. IC; AC, IC format should be used more sparingly. At most twice in an essay. Semicolons should be used within the body paragraphs, but can be used in the introduction paragraph and the conclusion. DEFINITELY NOT in the first sentence.
