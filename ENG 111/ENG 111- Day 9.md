<u>Notes</u>
Context and Conversation. That is what goes into introductions. Through an introduction, you show the reader that you have an alternative point of view that can be appreciated. It just gives a new thing for the reader to dive into, something fresh. 

Arm circle gesture is "accumulation"

Arsenal. You never know when you are going to need to talk about a specific thing, so being a jack of all trades and having a large/wide arsenal is crucial. 

While reading, you are going to remain at the same level of intelligence the whole way through. The discipline required to sit and read and reread and reread until something makes sense is what will set you apart.

Start reading fast and in an efferent manner. Get the key information from the text in the swiftest and most effective manner possible. 

Then, go slow. There are 5 steps here.
1. Make a mark. <u>Annotate</u>. Comment on the material that you just finished. If you can't annotate at the end of a paragraph, reread it. 
2. Find problems. Stop to note a problem or confusion in the text. Then, try to come up with a strategy for solving it. 
3. Read like a writer. Ask yourself about the decisions the author made. Why did they do this, why did they do that. 
4. Elaborate. Compare and contrast the text with other texts and draw out unstated implications from the it.
5. Memorize short bits. Learn key terms/phrases. This will help you understand and remember what you are reading. 

Visual Literacy is different than textual literacy. Visual literacy is the ability to make sense of a whole range of visual information. Essentially to be able to 'read' the visuals, appreciating and being able to interrogate or analyze both literal and inferred meaning.

Visual works are typically targeted to a certain demographic in modern times, specifically in the context of advertisements. Visual literacy entails being able to break down a picture or film just as well as you can do for a text work.

Read rhetorically, attentively, and intentionally.
