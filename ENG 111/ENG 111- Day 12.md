<u>Notes</u>
There is no sentence that is more important than the first sentence. It is the first chance that you have to make an impact on the reader. It is a first impression. After that, the closing sentence is almost as important. It is the last profound moment in your writing. 

-Quote sandwiches-
1. Bread --> Setup
2. Meat and Veggies --> Quote
3. Bread --> Explanation

In writing, you want the best of the best. In this case, you want a nice brioche or multigrain french loaf with artisanal meat that was smoked for 36 hours.

Quote sandwiches are useful for any quote, and they should be how you format any quotation for the rest of your life. 

Setup- Reagan made an excellent point about space exploration. 
Quote- In his 1986 speech, he explains that "Blah Blah Blah"(69).
Explanation- The reason this point is so critical is because it's awesome. 

The setup gives a segue to the quote. The quote is the point you are making. The explanation is why this quote is important. 

Quotations cannot be ordinary pieces in your writing. Not everything in a speech is something quotable. There are quotidian moments in speeches, but there are some moments that cannot be paraphrased due to their profoundness. That is what you will put in a quotation. \

There is a minimum of one quotation per body paragraph. That being said, they should only be used for body paragraphs in this essay. The quote sandwich is only used for body paragraphs. In terms of placement, there should be AT LEAST a topic sentence before a quote sandwich. The topic sentence cannot be part of the first segment of the quote sandwich. Usually, there will be 2 or 3 sentences before the implementation or introduction of a quote sandwich. You will NEVER quote in topic sentences. A topic sentence is used to give a brief idea of what comes after it. 

You must always have a citation accompanying a quotation. You cannot scatter them throughout the quotes used in the writing, you must always use them.

If the Author's name is used in a sentence preceding the quotation, it is redundant to include it in the citation. 

A quote has to be something juicy or something out of the ordinary. If something is very ordinary, you can paraphrase it. If it is used in a quote, you are telling the audience that it is something special. Although paraphrases are not exactly what the author says, they still require an in text citation.

"Signal Phrases" You must never let a quote stand by itself. The most basic signal phrase: He/She says. If there is no signal phrase, it will be called a "floating quote."

In the editing phase, there should be time to be taken for recognizing floating quotes and eliminating them.

You must always use passive verb tense before a quotation. 

Remember that everything you did in the first essay is to be done in the second essay and every essay after it. 

The outline MUST be in outline format, do not turn in an essay.
