<u>Notes</u>

--Master Checklist-- 
(what you need to write at a high level)

- Semicolons due to them being able to connect two independent clauses. 
- Topic sentences because they are able to cover in a concise manner what will be discussed within the paragraph. They also connect back to the thesis.

- Rhetorical elements because they are used to properly engage and influence the audience.

<u>Other Notes</u>
The essay must include context. Context is important because it provides information for your reader. Another word for context is conversation. You must start broad in your writing, and then narrow it down, talking about rhetoric and language, and then introducing your thesis in the introduction to your essay.

The verb tense must be present tense.

Third person must be used.

Make sure to take time while editing. Ensure there is <u>NO</u> duplication, your in text citations must be proper, and your punctuation proper as well.

Your purpose in this essay is not to persuade, it is simply to see the rhetoric, analyze it, and understand why it is used. 

Ethos, pathos, and logos do not get capitalized. They are just words.

Punctuation never goes within the quotation, unless the punctuation is a question mark or an exclamation point. 

Your audience in this essay and going forward is the general academic audience, meaning that you should spend no time defining terms. This also means that since it is an academic paper, opinions should be left out.

For the rest of the essay after the thesis, MLK can just be referred to as King.
