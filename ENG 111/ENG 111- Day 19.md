<u>Notes</u>
Lesson for the last day: credentialing. 

Every time you use a source for the first time in a paper, you have to give it a credential. 

According to (author), (title) at (institution), "quote" (citation).

example- 
According to Sarah Smith, Professor of Law at Harvard University, "blah" (47).

This technique makes you look better by riding off the back of somebody who's actually smart. Don't bury the credential (only reference it in the works cited), because you miss out a chance to look better.

This only applies to the first time that you have a source.
