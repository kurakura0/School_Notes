To be covered in class today- Outlines and the essay.

	- One intro

	- 6 body paragraphs

			- Introduces your opinion on the subject matter
		3. Point2
		4. Counter argument
		5. <u>Main</u> point
		6. <u>Main</u> point
	- One conclusion

Don't define fracking, everybody knows what fracking is already. Instead, show the audience interesting bits about fracking. Don't dumb it down.

Point1 is the least important point, and this is where you begin your argument. Point2 is the second most important point. Quotations, modes, punctuation, etc. all need to be there. 

Counterargument comes ONLY after your second point. The counterargument needs to be <u>sincere and genuine</u>. You're not trying to bully the other side, and there are other people in the world who have said good things about the other side. They are not to be discredited, they are to be given sincere attention because you show that you respect other people's viewpoints. Think back to critical thinking. The way that the counterargument is to be executed is not to ridicule or shred the other side, because everything has positives and negatives. 

The counterargument source can be one or two sources, doesn't matter. The single source will need to have two quotations to prove that you actually read them and understand their argument. Big names should go here like Harvard or MIT. 

The main point is the 'however moment'. The first sentence after the counter argument NEEDS to be is 'however,'. "However, what blah blah blah said failed to see that blah blah blah". 

The main point paragraph is supposed to be substantial, as it is the biggest part of the essay. It should be split into two paragraphs because it is the largest point. You should use the effects on the community for this because it has the biggest effect on people.

<u>Hook and Look</u>
This is a strategy for topic sentences. A paragraph is a mini essay, and a topic sentence is a mini thesis. One of the most important elements in writing is unity and cohesivity.

If you write a paragraph, it should be about one thing. Paragraphs need to be about a single thing and once you are finished with that singular thing, you move on to a new paragraph. 

To start a new paragraph, you need something that latches on to the last paragraph, ie. "Although cats are cool, dogs are better".

The strategy here is to hook on to the last paragraph and look forward to what will be talked about in the paragraph that the topic sentence is in. The transition moment is to be in the topic sentence. If you talk about one thing in a paragraph, it better be about one thing, not with a transition at the end of it talking about something else. By definition, a topic sentence is a transitional sentence. A topic sentence belongs in every body paragraph, not in the intro or conclusion. Basically, every body paragraph that includes a point needs to employ the hook and look technique. Every body paragraph needs a transitory sentence, in the form of a topic sentence. 

<u>Repetend</u> (noun)
You need to grab your reader's attention in the introduction. When writing an essay about pets, you don't talk about pets first. You would introduce it with talking about connection in friends, family, community, and finally religion. Then you can talk about religions like taoism, where they believe that gods are found in everything. Hugging a tree would be a significant moment where others would not find it. 

You grab reader's attention through context. Context shines light on smaller moments from larger points. For fracking, it's all about power. So, for context, you can talk about how power is a human struggle as old as we are. 

Repetend is the deliberate use of a repeated word or phrase that gains strength or effect upon the second use.

In the essay, this is part of the intro and the conclusion. In the intro, you can talk about one thing and then relate back to it in the conclusion.

**Watch "Mr. Holland's Opus"**

The commodification of water can be used as a repetend in my essay.

No first or second person unless it is in a quotation.
