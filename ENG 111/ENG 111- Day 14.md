<u>Notes</u>
Learned the 3rd semicolon rule. Refer to day 7 notes.
This rule kind of fights against the first two in that it doesn't specifically require independent clauses. It is a serial list. 

<u>Final Semicolon Rule</u>
An example given on the board for the third rule: 
- "My favorite pets are cats, dogs, and gerbils"
While writing at a high level, lists may need to contain supplemental information. 
- Example: "My favorite pets are cats, the most personality among domesticated animals, dogs, the most loyal of pets, and gerbils, perhaps the most adorable of pets"
In order to visually separate the information that is being provided, you can use semicolons. 
- Example: "My favorite pets are cats, the most personality among domesticated animals; dogs, the most loyal of pets; and gerbils, perhaps the most adorable of pets"
Complex serial lists need a coordinating conjunction after the last semicolon in the list. They are special moments, with a list that has really special things contained within. Reserve them to the middle section of the essay. The middle 2/3 of the essay is perfect. Don't do them too early or too late. Don't use them for every list you have. 

<u>Colons</u>
Colon Rule- "IC: X"
X is a variable, and it can mean anything. It can be a list, number, single word, name, another sentence, a quotation, whatever. A colon can do whatever you'd like it to do. You cannot use a colon without the independent clause preceding it unless you messed up. The variable must be something profound or memorable. A colon is a hard break, if something insignificant comes after, just don't use it. They should be used at least every other paragraph to every paragraph. 

A list of my favorite pets would include the following: cats, the most personality among domesticated animals; dogs, the most loyal of pets; and gerbils, perhaps the most adorable of pets.
