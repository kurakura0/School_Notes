<u>Notes</u>
The next essay are about fracking. This is a big concern for a lot of people, not just in the United States through our policymakers, but also internationally. It will be a persuasive essay, but it will use all of the elements previously covered. Rhetorical analysis and compare and contrast are still skills that will be needed. A bunch of articles/resources have been provided, but look for more. Since this is a current issue, many new sources can be found and used. Until the deadline, do not give up on researching new sources. You are not a scientist, so you must rely on quotes scientists and other professionals published. 

Assignment wise, theres one 'mid-tier' assignment, with many smaller ones and a couple quizzes. The essay will be 150 points, and between the essay due date and today, there can be ~100 points to be gathered. 

On top of everything that has been covered, new things will be added. For colons, 3-4 should be used because this essay will be 7-10 paragraphs long. A complex serial list should be included, but only once. 

Rhetorical situation is also known as your writing situation. Your audience is the general academic audience as per usual. This is important for this essay because you don't need to dumb it down for others, and you should be informing everybody around you with what you find in your research. Purpose is persuasion. Genre is a multimodal essay. The requirement for this essay is at least TWO extra modes, for a total of at least 3 modes. Can be 4-5 modes. The first mode is easy, paragraphs and sentences in the form of an essay. Aside from this, you can choose photographs, charts, videos, whatever isn't an essay. These require captions under the work if it is in the writing itself. Charts and graphs require the formatting of figure 1, 2, 3, etc. 

Words alone are not able to fully explain what photos and videos can show the reader. This is why you are using different modes in this essay. It is hard to do a picture justice in just words. 

In the selection of your modes, you are required one that leans into pathos and one into logos. If you are choosing a picture of a dead baby seal, you must use a graph that is purely informative. Balance in modes is a must. 

Your stance is your feeling or opinion to the topic. Stance is not tone, so once you've chosen your stance you must still choose an appropriate tone. Stance =/= Tone. You SHOULD choose a stance and tone that is biased, but not too biased. Be open to new opinions while researching. 



Fracking is the exploitation of environmental resources. Fracking is just the extraction of oil from the ground. The context surrounding this essay is not oil, it is the exploitation of environmental resources, bringing others under control; they are subjugating them. Fracking is not purely negative, there are some positives in it. There is real progress in communities economically where fracking is taking place, but there are many negatives such as health problems. Your job is to find whether destroying the natural environment is worth the price following it. 

Other things from the chapter include fonts and typefaces. Typefaces are not the same thing as font. Typefaces are the collection of characters that are stylized such as times new roman or helvetica. Font is what you do to the typeface, such as **bold** or *italic*. 

Every choice in this class compounds. 

The infographic on page 782 is not good. It is overburdened with information for an essay. If and only if it were displayed on a large billboard or placard, it would be great because the text size is appropriate. This would be horrible in an essay because there is way too much to show in such a small area in the context of an essay.
